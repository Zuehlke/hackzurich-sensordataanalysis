Sensor Data Analysis for [HackZurich](http://hackzurich.com/)

Based on [SHMACK](https://github.com/Zuehlke/SHMACK) deploy the components to perform sensor data ingestion and analysis in a [DC/OS cluster](https://mesosphere.com/product/) in the [Amazon AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/).
The data can get received from the corresponding [smartphone apps for iOS](https://github.com/Zuehlke/hackzurich-sensordata-ios) or [Android](https://github.com/Zuehlke/hackzurich-sensordata-android)

# What kind of sensor data?

So far, we are expecting and prepared to receive the different data described here: <https://github.com/Zuehlke/hackzurich-sensordata-ios/blob/master/README.md>


# Getting started
 
In order to be able to run the sensor data analysis in the cloud, you need a running cluster. 
This works best using [SHMACK](https://github.com/Zuehlke/SHMACK) with the following settings:
* Since Spark proposes In Memory computation and Cassandra/Kafka/HDFS provide their own redundancy, 
  better switch to memory-optimized EC2 `SLAVE_INSTANCE_TYPE` in `shmack_env`, e.g. [r3.xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).
  They are a bit more expensive, but significantly increase the data you can handle per node compared to the default (m3.xlarge).
  Spot instances are always a good choice if you want to save money and don't care if you may loose part of or your entire cluster if you get outbid.
* You may add all the packages you will need anyway in `create-stack.sh`: `INSTALL_PACKAGES="spark cassandra kafka marathon marathon-lb"`, 
  so they already get installed when you create your cluster using the CloudFormation template.
* Now you can go through the steps described in <https://github.com/Zuehlke/SHMACK> 
  from [Installation](https://github.com/Zuehlke/SHMACK#installation) to [Stack Creation](https://github.com/Zuehlke/SHMACK#stack-creation-from-now-on-you-pay-for-usage).
* Once the stack is up-and-running an you see on the DC/OS master dashboard that services are healthy,
  you can deploy the [Sensor Ingestion Akka REST Service](https://github.com/Zuehlke/hackzurich-sensordataanalysis/tree/master/sensor-ingestion#regular-deployment-into-a-shmack-dcos-cluster)
